# Tagbot  

Tagbot is an easy-to-use and lightweight tag storing and fetching bot for Slack.  

# Features  
```
/add_tag - adds a new tag
/edit_tag - edits the specified tag
/remove_tag - deletes the specified tag
/list_tags - lists all tags
/tag - sends the contents of the specified tag
/ping - test command
```

# Why?  
Well, Tagbot comes from both someone I know needing a bot like this, and my interest in how Slack handles applications. (they're pretty similar to discord ^-^)

# Usage
steal the code, sell the code, use the code, do whatever you want! i don't care!
